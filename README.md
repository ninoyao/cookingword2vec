## cookingword2vec

When I trying to find somedata set in Kaggle and practice some data science skill I found an interesting dataset. 
https://www.kaggle.com/c/whats-cooking
the competition asked people to predict the category of a dish's cuisine given a list of its ingredients. However, after making a logistic model, I think it would be more interesting to make a word2vec model. 

Word2vec is a group of related models that are used to produce word embeddings. 
In this model, you can find what may be the alternative ingredients from the recipe data set.
It just a simple model right now. 

Eventually I want to make a application that can generate new recipe.

Assume that there is only "beef curry" in the world right now, we can find the alternative ingredients of beef in our model. The most similar result of beef is "chicken" ,then we can create a new cuisine "chicken curry " now.

If you are interesting in this idea feel free to tell me your idea! there are still a lot difficulties.

## Update:

Here is how IBM did such things.

However, it seems like it already closed for some reason.
